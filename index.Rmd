## Application Background
### Motivation  
- Everyone of us has ever dreamed to be or to feel as a film director.  
- You could take a chance - let's start from the movie idea.  
- Good title could signify sufficient part of success.  
- Or... Well, this is just fun! :-)

## About Application (1)
### App Sources  
- [MovieLens 1M Dataset](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/).  
  Stable benchmark dataset. 1 million ratings from 6000 users on 4000 movies. Released 2/2003.

## About Application (2)
### Calculations
1. We take all movies titles, their genre categories and average ratings from all users.  
2. Then, we perform basic text mining analysis (`package 'tm'`) for the most frequent words in 4000 movies titles.  
3. At this step we train simple `glm` model to predict average rating (on a scale from 1 to 5) by frequent words dataset and the movie genre.
4. And that's it. You could try the new shinyapp [here](https://irinagoloshchapova.shinyapps.io/MovieTitleIntuition). 
   And look at the full code [here](https://github.com/IrinaGoloshchapova/DevDataProd).

## About Application (3)
### How to use
1. Come up with the best title for your New Great Movie and enter it into the "Title" box. By default, we assume that your movie title is "Third Zombie Train". I think that it would be a great movie! And what about you?  
2. Choose a genre for your New Great Movie in "Genre" box.
3. Push the button "Update Your Movie Rating Forecast" and look at the forecast of the average rating of your movie on a scale from 1 to 5.  
   **NOTE:** *Please, be patient!* The app initialization (first-order calculations) could take 3-4 minutes. Then, from the second title input it works really fast. Enjoy!
